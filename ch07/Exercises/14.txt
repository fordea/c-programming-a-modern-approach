Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of f correctly
(assuming that f and frac_part are float variables)?

frac_part = f - (int) f;

This statement does compute the fractional part of f correctly because of
operator precendence

e.g: f = 5.6

(frac_part = (5.6 - ((int) 5.6)));
(frac_part = (5.6 - 5));
frac_part = 0.6;

Order of presendence is
Cast (3)
Subtraction (5)
