Write declarations for the following variables and functions:

(a) p is a pointer to a function with a character pointer argument that returns
    a character pointer.

    char *(*p)(char *));

(b) f is a function with two arguments: p, a pointer to a structure with tag t,
    and n, a long integer. f returns a pointer to a function that has no
    arguments and returns nothing.

    void *f(struct t *p, long n)(void);

(c) a is an array of four pointers to functions that have no arguments and
    return nothing. The elements of a initially point to functions named
    insert, search, update, and print.

    void (*a[])(void) = {insert, search, update, print};

(d) b is an array of 10 pointers to functions with two int arguments that
    return structures with tag t.

    struct t (*b[10])(int, int);
