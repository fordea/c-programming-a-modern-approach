Show the output of the following program and explain what it does.

#include <stdio.h>

int f1(int (*f)(int));
int f2(int i);

int main(void)
{
    printf("Answer: %d\n", f1(f2));
    return 0;
}

int f1(int (*f)(int))
{
    int n = 0;

    while ((*f)(n)) n++;
    return n;

}

int f2(int i)
{
    return i * i + i - 12;
}


f1 is a function declaration with one argument: a pointer to a function with one
int argument that returns an int.

f2 is a function declaration with one int argument, with return type int.

main calls the f1 function, providing it with the address of function f2
(As f2 is equivalent to writing &f2).

function f1 contains a while loop that will keep calling the function
pointed to by the parameter with increments of 1, until that function returns 
0 (As a boolean expression treats any non-zero value as true, and 0 as false)

the first call of f2 is provided the value 0. As it returns 0 * 0 + 0 - 12,
the value returned to f1 is -12.

As the value returned to f1 is -12, the while loop condition is still true, so
n is incremented by 1. f2 is now called with the value 1:
1 * 1 + 1 - 12.

As the value returned to f1 is -10, the while loop condition is still true, so
n is incremented by 1. f2 is now called with the value 2:
2 * 2 + 2 - 12.

As the value returned to f1 is -6, the while loop condition is still true, so
n is incremented by 1. f2 is now called with the value 3:
3 * 3 + 3 - 12

As the value returnd to f1 is 0, the while loop condition is now false. The
while loop terminates and n (3) is returned to main by f1.

The final output of the program is:
Answer: 3
