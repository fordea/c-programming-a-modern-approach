The following function is supposed to insert a new node into its proper place
in an ordered list, returning a pointer to the first node in the modified list.
Unforunately, the function doesn't work corectly in all cases. Explain what's
wrong with it and show how to fix it. Assume that the node structure is the
one defined in section 17.5.

struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    while (cur->value <= new_node->value) {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    prev->next = new_node;
    new_node->next = cur;
    return list;
}

The problem with this function is that it doesn't deal with two situations:
When either cur is null (empty list) or prev is null (first node in list).

We can fix this in two ways. Firstly by accounting for these special cases,
or by using a pointer to a pointer to list.

Special cases version:

struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
    for (; cur; prev = cur; cur = cur->next) {
        if (cur->value > new_node->value)
            break;  /* Break when we've found the node thats greater than new_node */
    }
    if (list == NULL) {
        return new_node;        /* Case where list is empty */
    }
    else if (prev == NULL) {
        list->next = new_node;
        new_node->next = cur;   /* Case where inserting before first node */
    }
    else {
        prev->next = new_node;
        new_node->next = cur;   /* All other cases */
    }

    return list;
}

Pointer to pointer version:

struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
{
    struct node **pp = &list;

    while (list) {
        if (list->value >= new_node->value)
            break;
        pp = &list->next;
        list = list->next;
    }
    *pp = new_node;
    new_node->next = list; 

}
