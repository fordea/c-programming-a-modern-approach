The number of elements in an array can be calculated using:
sizeof (a) / sizeof(a[0])

It can also be calculated using the expression:
sizeof (a) / sizeof(t) 
where t is the type of a's elements

The second technique is considered inferior to the first because if we 
decide to change the type of element that 'a' stores later down the line,
(for instance changing an int to a long, or a float to double).
then we would need to refactor every call to sizeof(t) to the new element
type so that we could correctly calculate the number of elements in the array.
