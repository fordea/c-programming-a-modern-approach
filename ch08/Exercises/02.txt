Describe how to use a digit (in character form) as an array subscript.

int number_count[10];
char seven = '7';
number_count[seven - '0']++;

The above snippet should increment the seventh element in the number_count
array by one.

Ascii codes for 0 to 9 are 48 to 57.  
number_count['7' - '0']++;
number_count[55 - 48]++;
number_count[7]++;
