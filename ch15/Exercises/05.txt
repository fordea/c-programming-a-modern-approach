Suppose that a program consists of three source files - main.c, f1.c, and f2.c - plus two
header files, f1.h and f2.h. All three source files include f1.h, but only f1.c and f2.c
include f2.h. Write a makefile for this program, assuming that the compiler is gcc and that
the executable file is to be named demo.


demo: main.o f1.o f2.o
    gcc -o demo main.o f1.o f2.o

main.o: main.c f1.h
    gcc -c main.c

f1.o: f1.h f2.h
    gcc -c f1.c

f2.o: f1.h f2.h
    gcc -c f2.c
