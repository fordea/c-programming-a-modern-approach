We can see that there are no break statements after each case statement, 
causing the program to "fall through" to the next cases without checking any case label.

First of all, The switch statement evaluates the "controlling expression" 1 % 3 (the remainder of 1 / 3) and prints the result in string format.
Then, control jumps to the case label that matches it (case: 1), thus it prints "one",
after that, control falls through to the next case (case:2), and prints "two".

Therefore, the expected output is "onetwo".
