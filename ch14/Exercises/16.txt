Assume that the following macro definitions are in effect:

#define IDENT(x) PRAGMA(ident #x)
#define PRAGMA(x) _Pragma(#x)

What will the following line look like after macro expansion?

IDENT(foo)


The C99 standard states:
A parameter in the replacement list, unless preceded by a # or ## preprocessing token or 
followed by a ## preprocessing token, is replaced by the corresponding argument after all
macros contained therein have been expanded.

Therefore the parameter in IDENT is stringized before being expanded to the PRAGMA macro:
PRAGMA(ident "foo")

This expands the PRAGMA macro to:
_Pragma(#ident #"foo")

which stringizes the arguments to:
_Pragma("ident" "\"foo\"")

which is finally destringized by _Pragma to:
#pragma ident "foo"
