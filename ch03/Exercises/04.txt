scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);

assume i & j are int variables and x is a float variable.

if a user enters:
10.3 5 6

the values of i, x and j would be:

i = 10 - scanf reads the '1' and '0' then encounters the '.', since an integer
variable cannot contain a decimal point, 10 is stored into i, and the '.' is
placed back into the input string, leaving it with:

.3 5 6

x = 0.3 - since the next variable is a float (x) and thus can contain decimal points,
scanf reads the '.', then the '3', then the ' ',  Since the ' ' (a white space character)
character cannot be part of a floating point number it is put back into the input string.
This leaves '.3' to be placed in the float variable. As no value is provided before
the decimal point it is given the value 0.3.

 5 6

j = 5 - scanf reads ' ' and skips/ignores it, then '5', then the ' ', as the last ' ' 
cannot be part of floating point number, it's placed back into the input string.
Leaving just the value of 5 to be assigned to j.

 6
As no more variables remain to capture the input, ' 6' can only be accessed with
another scanf call.
