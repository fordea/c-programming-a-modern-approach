scanf format strings equivalency

(a) "%d" vs. " %d" - Equivalent, white-space character in format string matches
ANY number of white-space characters in the input string (including none).

(b) "%d-%d-%d" vs. "%d -%d -%d" - Different, the first one does not work 
properly white-space between the conversion specification and dash, but the 
second one does.

(c) "%f" vs. "%f " - Different Input, But capture same values (a single float)
"%f" requires a number to be input and the user to hit enter. e.g: 34.05->

"%f " requires a number to be input, then one or more white-space characters,
then finally any number of non-whitespace characters. e.g: 34.05  v->

Either way the captured float value would be the same, the second format which
requires white-space and any non white-space character would keep prompting
the user with input lines until they do enter a character, however this input
will not be captured by the format string.

(d) "%f,%f" vs. "%f, %f" - Equivalent, white-space characters in format
string match ANY number of white-space characters in the input string
(including none).
