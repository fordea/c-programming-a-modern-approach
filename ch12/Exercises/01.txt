Suppose that the following declarations are in effect:

int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 54, 14, 2, 52, 72};
int *p = &a[1], *q = &a[5];

(a) What is the value of *(p + 3)? 14
(b) What is the value of *(q - 3)? 34
(c) What is the value of q - p? 4
(d) Is the condition p < q true or false? true
(e) Is the condition *p < *q true or false? false
