The following program outline shows only function definitions and variable
declarations.

int b, c;

void f(void)
{
    int b, d;
}
void g(int a)
{
    int c;
    {
        int a, d;
    }
}
int main(void)
{
    int c, d;
}

For each of the following scopes, list all variable and parameter names visible
in that scope. 

(a) The f function: b and d inside the f function. c external variable.
(b) The g function: a (g parameter), b and c external variables.
(c) The block in which a and d are declared: a and d inside the block, c inside g function,
    b external variable.
(d) The main function: b external variable, c and d inside main function.
